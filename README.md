[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

Started late and playing catch-up. Trying to complete the calendar using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I've only played around with 
Rust a handful of times, so this code will probably be non-idiomatic and generally non-optimal. I spend most of my days writing
Python, so I'm trying something new to exercise my brain for the new year.
